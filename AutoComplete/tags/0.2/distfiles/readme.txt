* About AutoComplete

  AutoComplete is a Swing library that facilitates adding auto-completion
  (aka "code completion, "Intellisense") to any JTextComponent.  Special
  integration is added for RSyntaxTextArea (a programmer's text editor, see
  http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea/ for more information), since this feature
  is commonly needed when editing source code.
