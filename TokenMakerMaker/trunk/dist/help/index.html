      TokenMakerMaker is a utility to help you create TokenMakers so you can
      add syntax highlighting for new languages in RSyntaxTextArea.  If you
      want to add support for a DSL or other language not natively supported
      by RSTA, and the language structure is similar to many of the popular
      languages of today such as Java, C++, or Perl, then TokenMakerMaker can
      be a valuable tool.

      Select specific documentation to the left.  Alternatively, all dialogs
      and panels in TokenMakerMaker have links directly to help pages about
      them.
