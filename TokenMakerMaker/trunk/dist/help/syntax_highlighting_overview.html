      <h2><nobr>RSyntaxTextArea - Syntax Highlighting Overview</nobr></h2>
      <hr/>
      
      <p>
      Syntax highlighting for a programming language is handled by an instance
      of the org.fife.ui.rsyntaxtextarea.<b>TokenMaker</b> class.  This is
      RSyntaxTextArea's version of a lexer.  Content from an RSyntaxTextArea
      is passed into this class, one line at a time, and it returns a list of
      org.fife.ui.rsyntaxtextarea.<b>Token</b>s specifying how the text should
      be syntax highlighted.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      There are two primary ways to create TokenMakers:
      
      <ul>
         <li>The first way is to write a lexer by hand.  This of course can be
         a lot of work, and is very error-prone.  Lexers for complicated
         languages can get unwieldy very quickly.</li>
         <li>The second way is to write a lexer via JFlex.  If you are familiar
         with JFlex or any other lexer generator, you'll know how much simpler
         this makes your task.  If you're unfamiliar with the tool, however,
         the learning curve can be fairly steep.  What's worse is that
         RSyntaxTextArea requires some specific modifications to the standard
         lexers generated by JFlex (which could be removed via a custom
         template, but that currently does not exist).</li>
      </ul>
      
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This is the reason that <b>TokenMakerMaker</b> was created - to simplify
      the generation of lexers (TokenMakers in RSyntaxTextArea-ese) for common
      languages.
