      <h2><nobr>General Tab</nobr></h2>
      <hr/>
      
      <p>
      The General tab allows you to enter basic information about your TokenMaker.
      Here's a breakdown of what each field means:

      <div class="tableBackgroundDiv">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
      
         <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Package</td>
            <td>The package for the generated class.  This can be left blank if
                the class is to be in the default package.</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Class Name</td>
            <td>The name of the class to generate.  By convention, this should
                end in "TokenMaker", for example, "MyLanguageTokenMaker".</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Syntax Type</td>
            <td>The difference between "C-derived syntax" and "All others" is that
             the former will cause your TokenMaker to auto-indent after lines
             ending in '{', as well as auto-align closing '}' chars when they
             are typed (assuming auto-indent is enabled in the RSyntaxTextArea
             it's running in).  It's supposed to be the option you want to pick
             if the language you are creating derives syntax from C, and uses
             curly braces to denote code blocks.</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Class Comment</td>
            <td>Used as the Javadoc comment for the generated class.  Each line
                is prefixed with " * " to keep the source looking pretty.</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Case-sensitive</td>
            <td>If checked, the language is considered to be case-sensitive.
                This means that keywords, functions, etc. are only matched if
                they are found in the exact same case as they are specified
                in TokenMakerMaker.</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Highlight boolean literals "true" and "false"</td>
            <td>If checked, then the literals "true" and "false" are colorized
                according to the RSyntaxTextArea's color scheme as boolean
                literals.  You'll probably want to check this if your language
                defines these boolean literals.</td>
         </tr>
         
      </table>
      </div>
